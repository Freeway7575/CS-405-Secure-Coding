# CS-405-Secure-Coding
### Course Description
Students will focus on common security vulnerabilities that are found in software. Students will learn techniques and strategies to develop robust and secure code, leveraging secure programming principles. Students will gain authentic experience identifying security vulnerabilities and writing secure code to mitigate risks to software and data.

Competency Projects
The course goals are communicated through three competency statements. Competencies represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field. Additionally, there is not a single final project. Instead, there are two milestones building up to two projects tied to the competencies. The amount of material covered, the level of difficulty, and the workload expectations are all typical of a 400-level course.

Project One (Module Six submission)
Students will produce a security policy based on coding activities, standards, principles, and best practices to prevent coding vulnerabilities and threats.

In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:

•	Determine potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses using best practices
•	Develop secure code to counteract threats

Project Two (Module Seven submission)
Students will produce a presentation of the security policy framed by a threat-level evaluation and the use of automation to prevent coding vulnerabilities.

 In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:

•	Use external testing methods to identify potential vulnerabilities
